                                ########################

This file is grouping a couple of features that could be implemented
in the future. 

	. TLS variables API
	. Use MMAP_FIXED mappings in debugger heap
	. Better rights than rwx for runtime injected phdr (try double-map)
	. Fix all warnings on all OS and (re)compile on HPUX

[quick]	. Use sigaction's context to populate reg's var on SIGINT/SIGSEGV
[quick]	. be able to change the compiler and compiling options
!!!	. Multiple BSS : symbol injected many times in find_bsslen (fixup_sctndx really useful ?)
!!!	. Put doxygen comments and generate the ELF shell reference manual
!!!	. Update manpage

	<----- Here release 0.7-portable

[Main TODO]
	. Support step over, step into, step in sources
	. Conditions on breakpoints 
	. Add ALTGOT vector (need a small fix in the alpha algorithm)
	. Finish ET_REL for MIPS
	. Complete MIPS SHT/DYNAMIC types ASCII's
	. Better function hijacking to replace breakpoint opcodes
	. Be able to add new internal types using the script language
	. Be able to breakpoint a debugger function
	. More high level control flow : while if else if endif end
	. Hash tables working with 'foreachof' and 'eol'
	. File reconstruction from memory
      	. Support file building from scratch and support ET_REL injection on it
	. Signal proxying working in multithreads
      	. SUN Version section rw API (and add it to the hierarchy)
	. DWARF support and step in sources
	. Packer/Unpacker hook interface (Generalized hooking VM interface)
	. Hook command (include hlist)
	. Watchpoints on memory (problem: debug registers are ring0 only)
	. Use a runtime symtab/strtab for memory modifications
	. Signal proxying (when the debuggee set signals)
	. support X/x number types [regx] command and D regx regx commands
	. Replace all #ifdef __DEBUG*__ by ELFSH_PROFILE_DEBUG() calls
	. e2dbg scripts from cmdline (filexist, $var1_blabla$var2 format)
	. Better runtime EXTPLT (without mprotect)
	. unredir and undisplay command
	. b __guard@libc.so.6 format
	. Be able to bt without fp
	. Include hooks in scripting language
	. ltrace multiarch
	. add syntax explaination in help
	. e2dbg VS gdb (undisplay, bt with core, frame command, call command)
	. uuprint command
	. add ~ expansion
	. Recode paxctl in elfsh script
	. add vsyscall table support : http://lwn.net/Articles/30258/
	. Execution of script located in .elfsh.d/ from IMODE 
	. Leave command : exit the debugger by unmapping it

[porting]
	. Debug PaX-safe third-type injection on SPARC / ALPHA
	. CFLOW for SPARC and ALPHA
	. Dumpregs, Breakpoints, Backtrace on SPARC
	. EXTPLT / ET_REL into ET_DYN for SPARC
	. Dumpregs, Breakpoints, Backtrace on ALPHA
	. EXTPLT / ET_REL to ET_DYN on ALPHA
	. Dumpregs, Breakpoints, Backtrace on MIPS
	. EXTPLT / ET_REL into ET_DYN for MIPS
	. Full support for HPPA, PPC, ARM, IA64, AMD64

[minor bugs]	
. BUG : remove memleaks (VALGRIND!)
. BUG : reported by emperor (shnum, phnum, shsize modifs without data insertion)
. BUG : Check cmd_connect error handling
. BUG : NET client's (private) objects aren't unloaded on disconnection
. BUG : NET shell prompt displayed twice (! cmd) 
. BUG : multiple workspace on DUMP connection (actual->data->active && network.c:761)
. BUG : DUMP + e2dbg + cont/b/... 
. BUG : Cannot list notes anymore

[less important features TODO]
	. LKM & static kernel infection
	. DYNAMIC insertion API
	. Be able to call dtrace on Solaris
	. Support ELF32 / ELF64 at the same time
	. Improve completion (do better tables in tables.c)
	. CTORS, DTORS entry insertion API (need to change code references ..)
	. Section data, got, ctors, dtors, dynamic, rel*, plt removing ELF API
	. REMOVE VM commands for section data, dynsyms, got, ctors, dtors, dynamic, rel*, plt
      	. md5 known blocks to rebuild true symbol names in static binaries
	. SUN/x86 objets translation into GNU/x86
	. Libasm handlers scripting
	. Support 'addr' L2 field for got, ctors, dtors, rel, dynsym, sym (return the object address)	 
	. Advanced relocation entries lookup in grammar.c						 
	. INSERT VM commands for dynsyms, got, ctors, dtors, dynamic, rel*, plt, function
	. elfsh_export_symbol() (copy .symtab entry as a .dynsym entry)

[SHT RECONSTRUCTION]
[SHT rebuilding : use ELFsh 0.43b for a better implem of this feature]

 	. Bad .dynamic insertion => .shstrtab sh_offset += 9 (why ?)
	. fix bug in mapped_offset (offset not updated)
	. Bad sh_off in elfsh_rebuild_sht() => bad output file (why ?)
	. rebuild .text and .data using PHT (warn: size unknown!)
	. rebuild .init and .fini using .dynamic (warn: size unknown!)
	. consider the padding (max 3 bytes) in SHT reconstruct .
	. correct the '|' thing in PHT linking perspective .
	. Reconstruct .shstrtab if missing but SHT is present
	. SHT reconstruction paper
