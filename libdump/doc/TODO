	.:/ DUMP To DO list \:.
	
:: Created on Wed Mar 16 20:21:43 2005 ym ::


A. Known issues :

 - DUMP does not support NAT routers : 
	The Id that the other know as being mine is not the Id that I think i 
	have.
	=> In order to solve this issue, we should exchange Id at the begining 
	of the communication.

B. Code modifications : 
 
 - add negociation on connection.
 - add authentication on connection.
 - extend protocol to allow set of Id direct send (multicast) 
   and all directed send (broadcast).
 - allow easy definition of new message type, and corresponding handling 
   function.
 - allow to use other than TCP sockets (SSL, UDP, ...) -> add packet checksum
 - struct dump_op_s, dump_register(dump_type_t, function) ... ?
