this is a super awesome project i found at: http://www.eresi-project.org/ i have nothing to do with the project except that i greatly admire it, and i don't want to lose track of it.

although there isn't a license file with the source, their site at the time i pulled the code says it is licensed under General Public License (GPL) version 2. (see http://www.eresi-project.org/wiki/EresiTeamContact)
