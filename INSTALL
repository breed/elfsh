Please consider this package as a symbolic release. It is preferable not to install
it and to keep testing this from the uncompressed tarball source tree. The testsuite
is not up2date, however all new features presented in the Embedded ELF Debugging
articles are working and can be tested from testsuite/

Please visit elfsh.devhell.org regulary, new versions, more packaged, are coming.

For now :

1. ./configure --help (select your options)
2. make
3. make install
4. cd testsuite && make

-elfsh crew
