This should be a library for 'recovering symbol table'
with fingerprinting features and flow analisis
of a executable.

todo:

- main symbol
- ptr functions


Symbol table reconstruction:
app. 1) file scan from entry point till end of section
app. 2) using e2dbg

Fingerprinting:
 - creating DB 
  - using symboltable resolver
  - on request

ROADMAP: (* - means real live tests)
 - ptr_functions - some generic signatures (advenced
   stuff should be detected/traced by e2dbg) (*)
   - I need simple stack tracer!
   
 - call-references for every function (calling/calledby) (*)
  - maybe some additional fingerprint here?!

 - flow analisis (*)
